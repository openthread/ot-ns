# OpenThread Network Simulator

OpenThread Network Simulator (OTNS) simulates Thread networks using OpenThread POSIX instances and provides visualization and management of those simulated networks.

# Features

Note: this is version 2.x of OTNS. It offers additional features compared to version 1:

- Support for more accurate RF simulation of OpenThread nodes. This uses the OpenThread platform `ot-rfsim`, which specifically supports RF simulation for OT nodes. This C code is included.
- Selectable radio (RF propagation) models with tunable RF parameters.
- Runtime tunable radio parameters on each individual OT node. For example, CSL parameters or Rx sensitivity.
- Control of logging display from OT-node, using `log` and `watch` CLI commands. Logging to file per OT-node. The logging output can include any enabled OT-node log items.
- Detailed logging options for RF operations (at log-level 'trace') performed in the simulated radio, at 1 us resolution.
- See packets in flight: animations in the GUI with a duration scaled to the actual time duration of a packet in flight (works at low simulation speed only).
- Support for easily adding various Thread node types (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.4 Border Router).
- New graphical displays for overall node type statistics, and energy usage (beta - contribution by [Vinggui](https://github.com/Vinggui)).
- Extended set of Python scripts for unit testing, examples, and case studies.
- Key Performance Indicators (KPI) module that tracks counters and statistics for all nodes.
- Loading/saving of network topologies in YAML files.
- Custom startup scripts with OT CLI commands, defined in a YAML file.
- Additional ["WPAN-TAP"](https://exegin.com/wp-content/uploads/ieee802154_tap.pdf) PCAP format that captures channel information.
- Various UI look & feel improvements.
