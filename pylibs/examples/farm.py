# This script simulates a farm where sensors are installed on horses.
# 6 Routers are installed at the borders of the farm which has a transmission range of 300m.
# One of the Routers is selected as the Gateway.
# A SED sensor is installed on each horse to collect and transmit information to the Gateway.
# The horses moves randomly in the farm, thus SED sensors lose connectivity to their parents constantly
# and reattaches to new parents in range.
# This example shows that SED devices can handle parent loss gracefully to retain connectivity.
# The messages dropped due to parent connectivity loss can also be observed in the simulation.
